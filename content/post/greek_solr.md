Today I created a extensive mapping list of unicode to latin characters for solr. It contains some general accent mapping to the normal letter e.g. Ã© -> ue and a mapping for greek and cyrillic characters.

If you show the files in your browser it may be possible that you need to manually set the encoding to utf8.

* Greek mapping
* Cyrillic mapping
